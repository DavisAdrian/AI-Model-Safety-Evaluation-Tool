# **üîê Web Application Vulnerability Assessment of OWASP Juice Shop**

> A comprehensive **web application vulnerability assessment** performed on **OWASP Juice Shop**, an intentionally vulnerable e-commerce platform, using industry-standard tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite**, and **Nikto**.
>
>This project identifies **real-world security flaws** mapped to the **OWASP Top 10**, demonstrates exploitation techniques, and provides **secure coding solutions** in **Node.js/TypeScript** to remediate each vulnerability. The assessment highlights how common security gaps ‚Äî like **SQL Injection**, **Broken Access Control**, **Directory Traversal**, and **Business Logic Flaws** ‚Äî can lead to severe business and data breaches if left unaddressed.
